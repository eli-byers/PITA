# Personal Intelligent Task Assistant (PITA)

PITA is a system that enables users to communicate with an AI-powered task assistant using text messages. PITA can process user requests, manage internal states, and perform various tasks such as web scraping, text summarization, and sending messages.

## TODO

1. add multi threading
   1. thread one runs as background process handling messages and schedules
   2. thread two waits for user input to handle:
      1. command entered in the console
      2. safe shutdown, issues report of incompleted tasks and saves state

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Install the required dependencies (update this list as needed based on the APIs/libraries you choose):
   - For example: `pip install beautifulsoup4 requests twilio`

## Usage

1. Add your configurations and API keys to `PITA/pita/utils/config.py`.
2. Run the `PITA/pita/main.py` script to start the PITA system:
   - `python main.py`
3. Send text messages to PITA with tasks or goals you want it to perform.
4. PITA will process the requests, manage its internal state, and execute the tasks as instructed.

## Extending Functionality

The PITA system is designed to be extensible, allowing you to add new functions and integrations as needed. To add new features or integrations, follow these steps:

1. Create a new Python file in the appropriate directory (e.g., `PITA/pita/integrations` for new integrations or `PITA/pita/communication` for new communication methods).
2. Implement the new function or integration, making sure to import any required libraries or APIs.
3. Update the `PITA/pita/main.py` script and any other relevant files to incorporate the new functionality.
4. Update the `PITA/README.md` file with instructions on how to use the new feature or integration.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while using the PITA system, please consult the following resources for assistance:

1. Review the log files generated by the PITA system for any error messages or unexpected behavior.
2. Check the documentation for the APIs and libraries you are using to ensure they are implemented correctly.
3. Consult online forums, such as Stack Overflow, for guidance on common issues and solutions related to the APIs, libraries, and programming languages used in the PITA system.
